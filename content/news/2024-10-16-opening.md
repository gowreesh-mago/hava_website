On **16 October 2024**, Peter-Paul Verbeek officially opened the HAVA-Lab, hosted by the UvA Data Science Centre and located in the University Library Singel, the main building of the UvA Library.

The first PhD cohort had already started using the lab in May 2024, making this official opening a celebration of the research programme's formal launch.

HAVA-Lab brings together researchers from all seven UvA faculties to address the fundamental question: *What defines human-aligned video-AI, how can it be made computable, and what determines its societal acceptance?*

The lab was awarded following the UvA Data Science Centre Interdisciplinary Lighthouse Project Proposal call, where HAVA-Lab's proposal was ranked number 1. The review committee found the proposal compelling in its boldness of methods, interdisciplinarity, integration with the AI ecosystem, and potential outputs.

With seven PhD projects spanning cognitive, ethical, and legal alignment as well as real-world applications in criminal behavior detection, medical skill assessment, diagnostic training, and responsible marketing, HAVA-Lab aims to establish the UvA and DSC at the forefront of human-aligned video AI technology.
