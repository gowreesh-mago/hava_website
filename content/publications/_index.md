## Publications

Publications from HAVA-Lab aim to appear in technical-AI venues like CVPR and NeurIPS, multi-disciplinary venues like ACM Multimedia and ACM FAccT, as well as discipline-specific venues relevant for each project.

The lab culminates its outcomes into a virtual dashboard, where key findings are visualized and summarized in blogpost-style. Besides publications and PhD theses, we deliver the software and data that are part of each project.
