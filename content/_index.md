HAVA-Lab is a research programme that equips Artificial Intelligence for automated interpretation of video data with the ability to align with human values.

<p class="lead">What defines human-aligned video-AI, how can it be made computable, and what determines its societal acceptance?</p>

Video-AI holds the promise to explore what is unreachable, monitor what is imperceivable and to protect what is most valuable. However, the research community's over-concentration on recognition accuracy has neglected human-alignment for societal acceptance. To enable a responsible digital transformation, HAVA-Lab studies video-AI from a multi-disciplinary perspective.

HAVA-Lab is an interdisciplinary PhD programme of the UvA Data Science Centre (DSC), part of the UvA Library. Located at the University Library Singel in Amsterdam, we bring together expertise from all seven UvA faculties.
